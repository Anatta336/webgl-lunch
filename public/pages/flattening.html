            <p>The physical world appears to us as three dimensions. But our computer screens are flat.</p>
            <p>The first step in displaying a 3D scene on a 2D screen is to flatten it by projecting it and removing a dimension.</p>
            <p>This already happens in the natural world, with a lens in the eye focusing light on the retina.</p>
            <p>Humans have found ways to do it artificially, too.</p>
