    <h1>3D to Flat</h1>
    <p>The physical world appears to us as three dimensions. But our computer screens are flat.</p>
    <p>The first step in displaying a 3D scene on a 2D screen is to flatten it.</p>
    <p>This already happens in the natural world, with a lens in the eye focusing light on the flat retina.</p>
    <p>Humans have worked out ways to do it artificially, too.</p>
