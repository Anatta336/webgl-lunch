            <h1>Perspective 1486</h1>
            <p>After Ibn al-Haytham's work was translated into Latin, artists like Crivelli used the understanding of perspective to add the illusion of depth to their work.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of inconsistencies.</p>
            <p>But the overall perspective effect is clear.</p>
            <p>There's space on this slide, so:</p>
            <p>This is depicting the Annunciation, when the angel Gabriel tells Mary she will give birth to Jesus.</p>
            <p>The perspective-incorrect light ray with a little dove represents the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Gabriel is being interrupted by Saint Emidius, who is the patron saint of Ascoli Piceno, where Crivelli live, and the location this was painted for.</p>
